# Regular-expression-in-python

**NOTE** - Here I have made notes from the youtube tutorial by Corey Schafer ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8L6KVGG-7o))

### This is a quick overview of the re module in python for writing regular expressions to match patterns in strings.

- Quick explanations for code.
- Many examples.
- Directly see the outputs below the code block.
- Download and experiment with the code to get a deeper insight of what a pattern returns.
- A great to have ipynb to go through along with the youtube video.
